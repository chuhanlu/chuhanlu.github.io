## Short Bio
I am currently a Ph.D. student whose research interests lie in theoretical Computer Science, especially topics related to quantum algorithm and post-quantum cryptography. In 2017, I caught an opportunity and transferred my major to Computer Science. Prior to that, I received my bachelor’s degree in advertising.
