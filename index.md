## Short Bio
In 2017, I caught an opportunity to change my major to *Computer Science*. Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in *advertising*. I studied through the Post-Baccalaureate program offered by the CS department at *Portland State University* for one year and got admission to its Master's program. I earned my MS degree in 2019 and decided to keep my journey in more complicated but fundamental research.

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Portland State University supervised by Prof. [Fang Song](http://fangsong.info/). I am interested in theoretical Computer Science on varied topics, especially quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography.
