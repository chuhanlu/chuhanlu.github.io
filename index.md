## Short Bio
In 2017, I caught an opportunity to change to Computer Science. Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in advertising. I studied through the Post-Baccalaureate program offered by the CS department at Portland State University for one year and got admission to its Master's program. I earned my MS degree in 2019 and decided to keep my journey in more complicated but fundamental research.

I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at Portland State University supervised by Prof. [Fang Song](http://fangsong.info/). I am interested in theoretical Computer Science on varied topics, especially quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography.

## Personal Hobbies
I enjoy my life through movies, music, art and reading.

My favorite pianist/composer is [Dustin O'Halloran](https://dustinohalloran.com/) who wrote music for many movies. I like photography, watercolor, crochet/knitting, etc. Some of my practice can be found in
