                I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Rice University,
                where I work under the supervision of
                <a
                    href="https://sites.google.com/view/naihuichia"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="text-blue-500 underline font-semibold"
                >
                    Prof. Nai-Hui Chia
                </a>. I was fortunate to receive my Ph.D. from Portland State
                University under the guidance of
                <a
                    href="https://fangsong.info/"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="text-blue-500 underline font-semibold"
                >
                    Prof. Fang Song
                </a>, whose support shaped my research path. My current research
                focuses on quantum pseudorandomness in cryptography. I am
                particularly interested in understanding the differences among
                various quantum pseudorandom primitives and exploring their
                computational indistinguishability across different security
                settings from a cryptographic perspective.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Before diving into this line of research, my academic journey
                took a very different path. In 2017, I had the chance to switch
                my major to Computer Science after earning a Bachelor’s degree
                in advertising. I studied in the Post-Baccalaureate program at
                Portland State University for one year, then entered its
                Master’s program. I received my M.S. degree in 2019 and chose to
                continue pursuing more complex and fundamental research. I am
                especially grateful to Prof. Bryant W. York for his mentorship
                and encouragement during this transition, and I sincerely thank
                all those who helped me along the way.
