                I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Rice University,
                where I work under the supervision of

                >
                    Prof. Nai-Hui Chia.
                </a> I was fortunate to receive my Ph.D. from Portland State University
                under the guidance of
                <a
                    href="https://fangsong.info/"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="text-blue-500 underline font-semibold"
                >
                    Prof. Fang Song,
                </a> whose support shaped my research path. My current research centers
                on quantum pseudorandomness and its role in quantum cryptography.
                I study how stronger forms of pseudorandomness can be constructed,
                what structural and security properties they exhibit, and how these
                distinctions could shape a different landscape for quantum cryptography.
                I am also broadly interested in quantum cryptographic primitives that
                may not need to rely on classical minimal assumptions, and in understanding
                how the space of quantum-native cryptographic tools can be expanded
                and what kinds of applications such tools might enable. In addition,
                I am interested in the complexity-theoretic questions that arise from
                these primitives, as they shed light on how quantum cryptography fundamentally
                differs from its classical counterpart.

                Before diving into this line of research, my academic journey
                took a very different path. In 2017, I had the chance to switch
                my major to Computer Science after earning a Bachelor’s degree
                in advertising. I studied in the Post-Baccalaureate program at
                Portland State University for one year, then entered its
                Master’s program. I received my M.S. degree in 2019 and chose to
                continue pursuing more complex and fundamental research. I am
                especially grateful to Prof. Bryant W. York for his mentorship
                and encouragement during this transition, and I sincerely thank
                all those who helped me along the way.
